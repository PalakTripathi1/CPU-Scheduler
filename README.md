# CPU-Scheduler
Project Title: CPU Scheduler
Project Description: A multitasking operating system is one that
can simultaneously interleave execution of more than one process.
On single processor machines, this gives the illusion of multiple 
processes  running   concurrently.  Here is a CPU Scheduler which
organises the sequence or schedules various operations sequence to
be executed using algorithms as First Come First Serve and   Round  
Robin to implement the process.
